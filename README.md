This is the repo in which I post my data science, machine learning and deep learning projects
# Projects :
 - In this project, I built a car recommendation system. The web app searches for cars on a webpage processes the data and passes it through a machine learning model in order to list and display cars that probably would like to buy.
 - I used an ensemble model made of lightGBM and random forest and deploy it using docker container

# Project Motivation:

After a year living in Ireland, I decided to move back to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Covid-19 pandemic turned the whole world upside down. The point is, Rio de Janeiro is really big so having a car is almost mandatory. Based on that, I decided to create a web app that does the following: search for cars according to features that I specify, clean the data, pass it through a machine learning model and display display cars that are more related to what I am looking for. The app is working pretty well and the result is amazing. 


# Repository :
- Webapp - The deploy folder with all deploy files
- Notebooks - The folder with notebooks that show all the processes I took before deploy the web app.


# Stack 

- Pandas
- Numpy
